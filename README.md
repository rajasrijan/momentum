# Momentum
Momentum is a fun experiment I had started while I was in School. Aim of this project is to write Operating System from scratch. 
Originally I started writing in Assembly language then quickly moved on to C and later C++. 

Project was originally hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/momentum/) but later moved to Github after Google Code shutdown.

## Whatâ€™s there in momentum?
* Boots using GRUB2
* Multi-threading (multiple threads, mutexes, semaphores)
* Memory Management (paging, malloc, etc...)
* Basic driver loading (IDE & SATA driver, partial USB 1.0 driver)
* Can read from FAT32 filesystem
* Basic C, C++ runtime
* Basic shell commands (e.g. help, version, echo, lspci)

## Steps to build
1. Install MINGW (Linux users can skip this)
2. Build cross-compiles toolchain (binutils, gcc, g++) for target "i686-elf". C, C++ and LD should have the name "x86_64-elf-gcc", "x86_64-elf-g++", "x86_64-elf-ld". If they are different then update CC, CXX, LD in makefile.
3. Install NASM assembler.
4. Run "make all"

If build is successful "kernel.elf" will be generated. "kernel.elf" is multiboot compliant and can be loaded by any bootloader which supports multiboot.
